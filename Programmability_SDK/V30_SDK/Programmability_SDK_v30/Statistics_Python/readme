Building and Installing the IBM® SPSS® Statistics-Python Package

Introduction
------------
This directory is used to build and install the IBM SPSS Statistics-Python package for the following platforms:
    - Win64
    - UNIX (Linux64, MacOS, ZLinux64, PLinux64)


Prerequisites
-------------
    Visual Studio 2017 has to be installed
    XCode 10.3 or later version (For MacOS platform)
    Python 3.10.* has to be installed


Environment variables
---------------------
The following environment variables must be set prior to the building of Statistics-Python package:
    Win64:
        PYTHON_HOME - must be defined as the location of your Python installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
    Linux64:
        PYTHON_HOME - must be defined as the location of your Python installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <PYTHON_HOME>/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    MacOS:
        PYTHON_HOME - must be defined as the location of your Python installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <PYTHON_HOME>/lib to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    ZLinux64:
        PYTHON_HOME - must be defined as the location of your Python installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <PYTHON_HOME>/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    PLinux64:
        PYTHON_HOME - must be defined as the location of your Python installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <PYTHON_HOME>/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Building and installing the IBM SPSS Statistics-Python package using setup.py
----------------------------------------------------------
Usage Synopsis:

Creating the IBM SPSS Statistics-Python source package:
  python3 [path]setup.py sdist --force-manifest

Building the IBM SPSS Statistics-Python binary package, without installing it:
  python3 [path]setup.py build

Building the IBM SPSS Statistics-Python binary package, and installing it:
  python3 [path]setup.py install

Default Location of Output files:
  -- Binary package:
     [path]build/lib.platformInfo-pythonversion/spss, if you do not install the package
     <Python_Path>/Lib/site-packages/spss, if you do install the package
  -- Source package:
     [path]dist


Building a Windows extension module for Python 3.10
---------------------------------
Currently setup.py does not support building an extension module PyInvokeSpss.pyd
for the Windows platform so you need to follow the steps below to build the extension
module. After it is built, copy the created extension module to your installed IBM SPSS Statistics-Python Plug-In
package. For example, copy the extension module to <Python_home>/Lib/site-packages/spss.

For Win64:
  Prerequisites
      Visual Studio 2017 has to be installed
      Python-3.10.*-amd64 has to be installed

  Environment variables
    The following environment variable must be set prior to the building of
    PyInvokeSPSS.pyd:
      PYTHON_HOME - must be defined as the location of your Python installation

  Building PyInvokeSPSS.pyd using Makefile
    You can also build PyInvokeSpss.pyd using PyInvokeSpss.mak. First, open a
    Visual Studio 2017 x64 command prompt. Then go to the directory
    \...\Statistics_Python\spss\src\ and build PyInvokeSpss.pyd by
    using the following command:
      nmake -f PyInvokeSpss.mak PYTHONVERSION=3.10

    Output files will be put into the \...\Statistics_Python\spss\src\X64\Release subdirectory.

  Notes:
    - Currently PyInvokeSpss.pyd only has a release build. To build a debug
      PyInvokeSpss.pyd, python310_d.dll for x64 is required and that file is not
      supplied by the python-3.10.*-amd64 installer.


Notes
-----
For Mac, we recommend to use the system pre-installed Python to build package.

After the build succeeds, spssxd_path needs to be changed in the file spssxdcfg.ini in order to run the package successfully.
For windows this file should be located at <Python_Path>/Lib/site-packages/spss/spssxdcfg.ini,
For UNIX it should be at <Python_Path>/lib/python3.10/site-packages/spss/spssxdcfg.ini for Python 3.10

Change the package location.
On Windows, copy the package to <SPSS_HOME>/Python/Lib/site-packages
On UNIX platforms, copy the package to <SPSS_HOME>/Python3/lib/python3.10/site-packages for Python 3.10
On MacOS, copy the package to <SPSS_HOME>/../../Python3/lib/python3.10/site-packages for Python 3.10
