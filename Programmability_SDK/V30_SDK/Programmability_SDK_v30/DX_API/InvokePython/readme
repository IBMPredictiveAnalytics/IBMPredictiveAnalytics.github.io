Building the InvokePython310 Shared Library

Introduction
------------
This SDK directory is used to:
    -- build InvokePython310 Library for Windows (e.g. Win64) with Python 3.10.*
    -- build libInvokePython310 Library for UNIX platforms (e.g. Linux64, ZLinux64, PLinux64 and MacOS) with Python 3.10.*


Prerequisites
-------------
    Visual Studio 2017 has to be installed (for win64 platform).
    XCode 10.3 or later version (For MacOS platform)
    Python 3.10.* has to be installed (for all supported platforms).


Environment variables
---------------------
The following environment variable must be set prior to building the InvokePython310
shared library:
    PYTHON_HOME - must be defined as the location of your Python installation


Building InvokePython310.dll (for win64 platform)
----------------------------------------------
Using Visual Studio 2017
  There is a Visual Studio project file located under
  \...\DX_API\InvokePython\PCBuild\.
  Win64:
    Open InvokePython310.vcproj, select release and x64 option, build it.

Using a Makefile
  You can also build InvokePython310.dll using invokepython.mak. First, open a
  Visual Studio 2017 command prompt. Then go to the directory
  \...\DX_API\InvokePython\mak\ and build InvokePython310.dll by
  using the following command:
      nmake -f invokePython.mak PYTHONVERSION=3.10
      If you need the 64-bit dynamic library on Windows64, use: nmake -f invokePython.mak PLATFORM=Win64 PYTHONVERSION=3.10


Building the InvokePython310 library (for UNIX platforms)
---------------------------------------------
There is a Makefile located under \...\DX_API\InvokePython\gnumak\.
Go to the directory \...\DX_API\InvokePython\gnumak\
and run the following command from the shell:
      (g)make -f invokePython.mk PYTHONVERSION=3.10


Output files
------------
  Win64:
     If the project file is used, output files will be put into the \...\DX_API\InvokePython\PCBuild\X64\Release subdirectory.
     If the make file is used, output files will be put into the \...\DX_API\InvokePython\X64\Release subdirectory.
  Linux64:
     Output files will be put into the \...\DX_API\InvokePython\lintel64 subdirectory.
  MacOS:
	 Output files will be put into the \...\DX_API\InvokePython\macosx subdirectory.
  ZLinux64:
     Output files will be put into the \...\DX_API\InvokePython\zlinux64 subdirectory.
  PLinux64:
     Output files will be put into the \...\DX_API\InvokePython\plinux64 subdirectory.

Notes
-----
Built this way, the InvokePython310 library is a release build. To build a debug
version of InvokePython310 library, the python310_d library is required, which
is not currently supplied by the python-3.10.* installer.

After the build succeeds, a corresponding change needs to be made to spssdxcfg.ini in
order to use the Plug-in functionality with IBM® SPSS® Statistics. Also, you will
need to copy this file and the libInvokePython library to your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
location.
On Windows, copy both spssdxcfg.ini and the InvokePython310 library to the
root directory of $SPSS_HOME.
On UNIX platforms, copy spssdxcfg.ini to $SPSS_HOME/bin and copy the libInvokePython310
library to $SPSS_HOME/lib.

On MacOS, please add $SPSS_HOME/lib to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH before running the Python plug-in.
