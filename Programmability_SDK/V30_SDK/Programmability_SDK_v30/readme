INTRODUCTION
The IBM SPSS Statistics Programmability Extension SDK includes the following six subfolders:
  -- documentation: All documentation for the IBM SPSS Statistics Programmability Extension SDK. It includes documentation on using the IBM SPSS Statistics Integration Plug-ins (Python and .NET), the C API (referred to as the XD API), and the Dictionary and Output schemas. It also includes a Developer's Guide with information on building custom Plug-ins.
  -- DX_API: Tools for building shared libraries for the Python Plug-in can be found in the InvokePython sub-directory. An example of using the DX API to invoke Python from IBM SPSS Statistics can be found in the MyInvokePython sub-directory.
  -- Statistics_Python: Building and installing the IBM SPSS Statistics-Python Package.
  -- XD_API: Examples of using the XD API.
  -- XTension_Utility: Tools for running IBM SPSS Statistics XTensions.

KNOWN ISSUES
StartSpss. Using the XD API StartSpss function without an argument may cause the application
controlling the IBM SPSS Statistics backend to exit unexpectedly. You can avoid the problem by supplying an argument
which can be a blank or an empty string, for example StartSpss("").

In_process mode. Invoking StartSpss after having already invoked StartSpss and StopSpss may cause the application to exit unexpectedly.

Nesting. When using the nesting feature, we recommend using the out_of_process mode.
